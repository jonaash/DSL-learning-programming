# Eddie

Eddie is an educational computer programming language. The Eddie language gradually introduces loops, conditionals, variables, functions, and objects. It uses a domain based on Karel the Robot language, where users can control a robot character in a two-dimensional grid.

the language is designed in MPS ([jetbrains.com/mps/](https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/)). It was created as a master's thesis at [Faculty of Mathematics and Physics](http://www.mff.cuni.cz/) at Charles University in Prague.
